## Coding Challange 

Challenge:
Build a simple web application that allows users to search for a Stackoverflow account. 
 
Acceptance Criteria:
- As a user I want to be able to enter a Stackoverflow username (full or partial) so that I can search for the username
- As a user I want to be able to execute a Stackoverflow username search based on my input
 
Bonus Acceptance Criteria (if you have extra time):
- As a user when I select a search result, additional Stackoverflow account information should be displayed (location, reputation, etc.)
- As a user when my search returns no data I want to be informed that no data was available for my search parameters
 
Guidelines:
1. Must use Angular and the StackExchange API (to query Stackoverflow)
2. Donâ€™t worry about styling here, just make sure the application is usable
3. Push all code (along with commits) to a public Github repository
4. Reply to this email with a link to your public Github repository
